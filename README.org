* TTRPG-Web

This is, as of 2025-03-26, my latest attempt at building ttrpg-hangout.com.

- It's based on https://tedboy.github.io/flask/quickstart/quickstart1.html.
- The template stuff is from https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/templates/.

The aim here is to make a minimalist version of ttrpg-hangout.com that uses routes and templates, no SQL (initially), and just loads html files from a directory.

* Starting it

. ~/venvs/TTRPG-Web/bin/activate
./start.sh  # Will start it on 127.0.0.1:5000

* Status / Things that work

http://127.0.0.1:5000 is a default start page, but does not have navigation stuff.
http://127.0.0.1:5000/article/springhaven etc also works. This has navigation.

- What I'm doing now: Reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Introduction
